My entry for Ludum Dare 27!

A long abandoned city. Scout robots have been started appearing there recently.
Your mission is to seek them out and destroy them before they can cause harm to
anyone.

You've been fitted with the latest in weapon technology, a very powerful laser.
Use it wisely though: each shot uses up energy and when it runs out it takes 10
seconds to recharge.

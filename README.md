My entry for Ludum Dare 27!

A long abandoned city. You're on the run, hiding out there. Scout robots been
started appearing recently. Are they on to you, or is there another reason
behind it.

You have a laser to defend yourself, but its battery is old. You can only fire
it a few times before it run out of energy has to spend 10 seconds recharging.
